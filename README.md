# Speech Emotion Recognition

This project focuses on enabling machines to understand human emotions from speech.

### Key Features:

- **Emotion Detection**: Identifies seven types of emotions: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, pleasant surprise, sadness, and neutral.
- **Model Architecture**: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) layers for handling sequential data.
- **Feature Extraction**: MFCCs for capturing the phonetic properties of speech.
- **Accuracy**: 67% validation accuracy.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language.
- **Keras with TensorFlow**: For building and training the neural network models.
- **Librosa**: For audio processing and feature extraction.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Dataset Information

- **Source**: [Toronto Emotional Speech Set (TESS)](https://www.kaggle.com/ejlok1/toronto-emotional-speech-set-tess)
- **Details**: 2800 audio samples in WAV format recorded at 22050 Hz. Each sample is up to 3 seconds long.
